# playcard - Master Brain System

Developing a new type of system due to
1. Loads of wires from the Rasp pi
2. Needing Rasp pi with rfid scanner close to public (theft of rasp pi would loose everything)

Result, use the built in rasp pi 3+ bluetooth.
have multiable bluetooth module systems eg, rfid_scan, till, card_despencer etc..
Now able to leave rasp pi under counter in secure location

Access to rasp pi is via the LAN DHCP network it create's an manages, using a AP for Wifi to all the rfid scanners
Rasp Pi can also have internet access (via its built in Wifi to connect to Internet Hotspot) (for online updates an online backups)
